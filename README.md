# Understanding padel's unit economics



## **Inspiration**

During COVID 19 new sports have emerged and become popular.In Spain , where I currently live, many people started to practise padel as a sport.
That unexpected new trend made investors to put an eye on padel , creating new facilities.
As a curious and passionate person about sports , I decided to ask myself this question : 
- what makes padel an attractive investment to an investor?

As a first step , I will understand the market :
- where do people normally practice this sport?
- how much do they spend?

In addition ,this project has been supported by Padel 0 límites. Padel 0 límites is a brand that helps customers to make their best decisions on equipment, tactics and performance in padel.
